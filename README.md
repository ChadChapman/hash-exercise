## Running the solution for the `hash application problem`:

Nothing too fancy, just calling node and passing some args.

The args are as follows:

- file to run: `index.js`

- output value from the provided pseudocode hash function: `677842960118`

- flag representing the number of characters in the hash's original string: `-char`

- number of characters in the original string: `7`

Putting it all together, should look something like this:

`~ node index.js 677842960118 -chars 7`

which should produce output: `Is this your original string? --> gleeful`
